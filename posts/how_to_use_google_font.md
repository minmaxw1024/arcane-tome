## Why do we use Google Font?

First of all, I'd like a better looking font for my websiteðŸ˜‚

The benefits of using Google Font are:

- **Performance**: Google Fonts are hosted on a fast, reliable CDN. They can be loaded faster than self-hosted fonts(for non-chinese users).

- **Free**: Google Fonts are free to use.

- **Variety**: Google Fonts has a wide variety of fonts to choose from, and I can easily find the font that suits my website, by typing the text I want to display in the font.

## How to use Google Font in Tailwind CSS
